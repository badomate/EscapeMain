# Gameplay

## Surroundings
- Self-Contained (e.g.: [Scriptum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhtg9L6jUXM) )
- The Player is the scenery (e.g.: the Player moves and the scenery components move with them)
- Table-top like (e.g.: [Empire Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBI06ptde74&pp=ygUeZW1waXJlIGVzY2FwZSBhdW1lbnRlZCByZWFsaXR5)), perhaps with a giant tarp, like Twister, and several boxes included?
- Multi-location (e.g.: [Inkagames' maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji3BMer0lrs))

## Content
- Self-Contained puzzles, with several levels (e.g.: [Portal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0uVg9nuaS0))

## Possible Puzzles

## AI
### Capabilities
- The AI knows something the player does not:
    - It can pass through walls (e.g.: AI is a ghost)
    - It can hear/smell something you cannot (e.g.: AI is a dog/cat)
- The AI can interact with:
    - Objects with a given characteristic (e.g.: objects of the color pink, objects over 50 years old, objects that are non-corporeal, ...)

### Intelligence Level
- AI was born with a pre-defined level of intelligence:
    - High
    - Low
- AI learns as you give it instructions and it associates it them with a given action/object
- AI can give you instructions too

## POV
- 1st Person.

## Interaction
- Sign language (perhaps portrayed as in-game spells)
- Gestures indicative of specific objects/actions/colors (may imply a short amount of objects)
- Body language, such as jumping, waving, ... (e.g.: [Minecraft]() on mute servers, [Club Penguin on mute servers](https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Actions))
- Composed of content from simple, predefined options (e.g.: [Elden Ring messages](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messages), [Club Penguin quick chat](https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Quick_Chat), [animal speech buttons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPJwzL8awJk), [some ouija boards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfw_LvLZOQk), the [alethiometer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4PtNK0_F3Y) from His Dark Materials)

## Task Division
- Player and AI are on different sides of the same location and can only interact with objects there (e.g.: the Player on the floor and AI on the ceiling) 
- Player can interact with physical objects and AI with nonphysical ones (works well if the AI is a ghost-like figure)
- The player is in the Present and the AI is in the Past; the Past affects the Present and the Present communicates with past (e.g.: [The Past Within Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stpjpd1Vo3Q)). This could also work with different dimensions.
- Player controls one part of the in-universe interaction and the AI another, such as the arms/legs, movement in direction up-down/right-left, movement/rotation, ... (e.g.: [Octodad multiplayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djmp1oupoOQ), [Figuro](https://figuro.io/Designer))
- Player controls the scenery or **is** the scenery, AI is the one they must help escape (this allows for sabotage)
- Player and AI see the world differently (e.g.: Player sees colors differently; patterns in the differences could serve as clues)

# Story
- Prison escape:
    - Escape a prison-like room/series of rooms, while the AI is along for the ride
    - Medieval setting
    - Sci-fi setting
- Mystery:
    - Find who killed the Player/AI years ago
    - Find where the Player/AI's years old corpse was hidden
- Meta:
    - The AI is another player trying to play a co-op game where you both control objects as one part of a whole
